I am a senior at Hillsborough High School with a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science. To enhance my knowledge, I have participated in programs like [PACT](https://algorithmicthinking.org/) and [AOPS Olympiad Training](https://artofproblemsolving.com/school/course/woot-math), and completed courses from the University of Michigan and Rutgers University in linear algebra, computer science, and machine learning.

I actively engage in research to push the boundaries of machine learning. Currently, I am working on Alzheimer's diagnosis classification with deep neural networks under Dr. Yu Zhang at Lehigh Universityâ€™s [Brain Imaging and Computation Lab](https://yuzhangresearch.weebly.com/), and exploring encoded bias in LLMs with [Dr. Mohammad Taher Pilehvar](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/mp792) at the University of Cambridge.

As the founder of Modellum AI, I lead a consulting company that creates custom AI tools for financial institutions. Additionally, I am developing RecoverRight, an app designed to monitor and assess physical rehabilitation activities for elderly patients, in collaboration with Hillsborough Township administration.
